Romanian Kogaion desktop-oriented ebuilds. For the moment it's in pre-alpha stage. :)

To install it as an overlay in a Gentoo planet distro, use the command: 

layman -f -a kogaion-desktop -o https://gitlab.com/kogaion/kogaion-desktop/raw/master/overlay.xml

== Atention ==
In order to have this repo stable enough, we propose adding the 'kogaion' overlay also!
